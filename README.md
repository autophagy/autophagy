## Hi, I'm Mika. ðŸŒ¿

I'm a Berlin based software developer, mostly writing Python. 
Although secretly I really love pure functional languages like Haskell and Elm, and think algebraic types and category theory and monads are pretty neat.

I'm also into cybernetics (the Stafford Beer kind, less-so the Terminator kind), xenofeminism and Cronenberg's body horror movies.

Some cool things I've worked on or contributed to:

- [FÃ¦reld](https://github.com/autophagy/faereld) :: A CLI time tracking tool for optimizing my productive time.
- [HrÇ½w](https://hraew.autophagy.io/) :: A flask-based project information repository.
- [Scieldas](https://scieldas.autophagy.io/) :: A service to provide monochromatic badges for READMEs.
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) :: An opinionated Python code formatter (I gave a talk on it at [PyconUK 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLoMFu14wmk).
- [CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/crate) :: A distributed SQL database (largely on the tooling and infrastructure side).
- [PyLadies Berlin](http://berlin.pyladies.com/) :: A mentorship group focused on getting more women into the Python community (largely these days as Twitch VJ, but sometimes [giving talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO4qyBufcfQ).
